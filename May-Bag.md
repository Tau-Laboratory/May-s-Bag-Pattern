# Making May's Bag - A Decent Into Madness
![May's Bag](images/01.png)

So I needed a new bag and I thought, that it would be really cool to recreate the bag used by May in Pokémon.
Well... I still think that but the amount of work required to get there wasn't something I expected. 
It is definitely an interesting project and one that taught me a lot so I hope you'll find my little report interesting...
And maybe it'll help you should you want to try a similar project.

I will tell you exactly what I did, how I messed up and what I would do different. 
Making May's bag is not and easy project by any means but I believe that there are many mistakes that I made that you can avoid.

## Planing and Drafting

So I started this project with a couple of requirements.
I wanted the bag to look like the one in the anime and thanks to some really nice reference I found on Tumblr that wasn't too difficult.
[Link](https://pokemonsettei.tumblr.com/post/178351513787)
Next I had some needs as to size and layout. 
I wanted it to have space for a bottle of water, and a camera, a notebook and some other stuff.
It should have a space for my valuables, be generally waterproof and not get in the way while moving about.

With this list of requirements I set out to create a pattern for the bag:
The bag is primarily two large rounded rectangles that are a bit bigger than a piece of A4 paper. 
A zipper runs around most of the height and width. 
There are two pockets at the front with magnet closers. 
A large inner pocket attached to the back panel with a separate zipper for valuables and large enough to hold a full sheet of paper,
The inside is further separated into three compartments by two strips of fabric.
The left and right compartments are for a bottle and the zoom lens for my camera while the central compartment is for the camera itself.
The bag has a strap to tie around your waist.
A piece of padding holds the strap and sits between the wearer and the bag itself.

You can find an SVG version of the pattern [here](https://github.com/Tau-Laboratory/May-s-Bag-Pattern).
My apologies in advanced for the "First Semester Drafting Assignment" aesthetic.
You can either have someone with a plotter print it too scale or use the provided measurements to construct your own.
I did most of it just with a straight edge, compass and a set square. Everything else you can freehand.

I also highly recommend making a test piece using muslin on any other cheap fabric at hand. 
This will give you a much better understanding of the dimensions of the bag.
Plus it'll help you think about the construction before you cut up the good stuff.

Additionally you can (and probably should) make adjustments to the pattern.
Change the layout to suit your needs / wants.
During the sewing process I came across multiple situations where a more thought out pattern would have made it significantly easier to sew. 
I will mention those in the section of construction. 

## Materials

For making the bag I used the following:
- 1.5m yellow cotton jersey
- 0.5m cotton canvas
- 0.1m of silver fabric for the highlights on the outer pockets
- 6 rolls / 300m yellow sewing yarn - yes, 6 rolls. I cleared out the entire stock of yellow yarn in my local fabric shop
- some white/silver yarn
- 1 roll of yellow bias tape
- 0.5m of padding foam (I used Plastezote LD45 but others should work as well)
- 1 large yellow zipper (~ 75 cm) for the outside 
- 1 smaller yellow zipper (~ 35 cm) for the inside
- 1 ~1.5m * 30mm yellow belt strap 
- 1 yellow belt clip
- 2 pair of sew-in magnets for the outer pockets
- beeswax and paraffin for weather proofing

![Overview over the materials used](images/02.png)

This collection of materials is mostly what I had available and by no means the "optimal" selection.
Most of the construction is canvas sandwiched between cotton jersey.
I disliked the texture and feel of the raw canvas but jersey alone felt a bit flimsy.
This made the project a lot more difficult since I had to sew 6-9 layer at a time.
Not something my machine enjoyed doing.
Should you plan on making the bag look for some weatherproof canvas in the right color and skip the whole song and dance of making the three layer sandwich.
That will save you a lot of time and quite a bit of yarn.
The tradeof of doing it this way is that you'll need more bias tape.
With my sandwich method all pieces where seamed by default. 
This shouldn't be an argument against doing that anyways but you still have to keep that in mind. 

## Cutting and preparing the pieces

Next we can start cutting the fabric. 
Note that my pattern has **no seam allowance**.
You have to add that yourself depending on your preferences.
Cut the pieces.
Before we assemble the bag you should prepare as many of the pieces as you can. 
Because right now you can easily access the stuff.
Once we start assembling this will change quickly.
I definitely recommend marking the center/alignment lines to make the assembly easier. 
Especially for the zipper, bottom, and side panels.

### The Back Padding
The back padding is a trapezoidal piece of patting foam in a case of fabric.
You can easily finish the entire thing:
Cut two pieces of the fabric, sew them mostly closed.
I recommend pressing the seams at this point for a nicer finish.
Turn the fabric bag inside out.
Cut a piece of the padding and insert it into the bag.
Then sew it closed (I did it by hand to hide the seam.)

###  The Inner Pocket
![The inner pocket during assembly. Currently still inverted.](images/03.png)
The inner pocket is just a rectangular bag. 
The opening is moved down a bit so the zipper is at a more comfortable position.
Cut out the fabric and press along the folds.
Separate and attach the zippers.
Then sew it like a normal bag / pillowcase:
Invert, sew, press the seam, finish the seam, invert again, and you're done.

### The Outer Pockets
![The outer pocket during assembly. Currently without the magnets.](images/04.png)
These are probably the most involved individual piece.
The way I made them was finish the pockets and then attach the magnets and the silver trims by hand. 
This certainly works but with a bit of planning you can also fully machine sew them:
Cut the fabric and finish the top and bottom (the ends that will form the lip of the pocket and the flap for closing).
I recommend pressing along the edges to give the shape of the pocket.
At this point I would pin the pocket together to make it easier handling the magnets.
You can also use this step to double check the construction:
 
![Pinning the magnets to the outer pocket.](images/05.png)
Attach one magnet on the flap and its partner on the lip so that they meet when closing the pocket.
This is pretty straightforward:
Attach the one on the flap and then place the other where the flap naturally wants to move.
Then cut and finish the silver trim pieces.
I my case this was a fake leather fabric that didn't need finishing so I attached it raw.
Place the semi circle on the flap (so that one quarter circle is outside and the other on the inside)
Place the single quarter over the lip.
Make sure to double check that the circles "look" the right way. You should get two pockets that are mirror images of each other.
When closed the trims should perfectly match.
Sew them on using some white/silver thread.
Then you can finish the pockets by inverting them.
Sew, press, finish, and you're done

### The Separators
![The two separators. The creases have been pressed to ease pinning.](images/07.png)
Not much to do here apart from cutting and finishing the edges.
I would recommend pressing the creases along the lines so you get a L shape.
This will help you align it. But that is mostly optional.

### The Bottom 
![The bottom piece. The padding has been sewn into the center of the piece.](images/08.png)
The bottom has another piece of padding to shield the contents of the bag.
The way I did it was analogous to the back padding:
Cut two pieces of fabric and a piece of padding.
Though in this case you don't need to invert it. Instead just make a simple sandwitch and sew though the padding.
Finish the short edges.
The long edges can be attached and finished when we do the final assembly.

### The Zipper
![The finished zipper piece.](images/09.png)
For the Zipper cut the long strip and cut it in half lengthwise.
Then sew in the zipper.
Finish the short edges.
The long edges can be finished later.

## The Assembly
![An exploded view of the bag and all of its components.](images/10.png)
Now get ready for the true brain twister.
Assembling the bag in a way that doesn't have a lot of visible seams on the outside requires quite a bit of planning but you can do it.
First try pinning the bag together so you know how everything should go together.
Make note that the outside pockets are correctly layered out (the round edges of the trim facing away from each other).
This is also when you test the height of the belt strap on the bag.
See that you like the placement.
I would try sitting down with the bag attached and make sure its not getting in the way.
Make sure all the zippers can be easily accessed and open the right way.

### The Back Panel
Here we have the back padding, the belt strap, the inner pocket, and off course one of the side panels.

![The back padding is attached to the back side panel.](images/11.png)
We need to attach the back padding before the inner pocket since we otherwise we would have to sew though it.
The way I did it was first attach the top edge of the inner pocket.
Then attach the back padding with multiple horizontal stitches. 
Then finally finish attaching the inner pocket.

Align the vertical center of the padding with the vertical center of the side panel. 
Make sure that your belt strap fits between the horizontal stitches so you can actually attach it to the bag.
Also keep away from the edges! Make sure that the edge of the side panel can be attached to the rest of the bag without having to deal with the back padding or the inner bag. 
Trust me. You don't want those get caught up in your bias tape.
 
### The Front Panel
![The "inside" of the front panel showing how to attach the separators.](images/12.png)
The front consists of the two outer pockets, the bottom, the other side panel, and the inner separators.
The way I did it was to attach the bottom first (make sure to match the center marks).
Then pin the separators in place.
Sew the separator to the front panel but not yet to the bottom.
Then place the outer pockets to cover up the stitch line of the separators.
![One outer pocket being sewn in place along the opening flap.](images/13.png)
You can machine sew the tops of the pockets to the front panel and then use a narrow whipstitch to attach the bottoms and the sides.
The separators. are easiest to finish during the final assembly.

### Putting it all together
We're getting to the last steps of the assembly:
Attach the bottom to the back panel (Again match the center marks)
![The zipper is pinned in place in perpetration for sewing.](images/14.png)
Pin in the zipper and make sure that while you're wearing it the zipper is at the right position. 
I wanted mine to face towards the front while closed.
But your preference may differ.
Then separate the zipper and attach that.
Now attach the short ends of zipper and bottom in a way that allows the zipper to disappear when fully opened/ closed.
![A side view of the bag. The bottom and zipper pieces have been sewn together.](images/15.png)

We're on the home stretch. You should now finish the long edge of the zipper / bottom / side panel. 
I ran a surging stitch all around the perimeter before finishing with a piece of bias tape. 
Make sure this stitch is solid as it is the one thing standing in between you having a bag and you having a bunch of stuff falling to the ground.
I used a very short stitch length and multiple stitches and checked for any holes anywhere.
![A closeup to the bias tape during assembly.](images/16.png)

Lastly you have the inner separators. left to attach to the bias tape. 

Finish up by pushing the belt strap between the back padding and the bag. 
You can either sew it to the bag / padding or leave it unattached. 
Attach the belt clip and your bag is done.

Congratulations. 

## Waterproofing
Since I want my bag to last and not get dirty. 
I decided that I wanted to try my hands on some water/ weatherproofing.
If I were smart I would have simply picked a fabric that was already designed for that purpose... 
So if you listened to my recommendations you can skip that part.

I had some yellow jersey. 
Not the optimal fabric for a trainer / coordinator to run around in. 
To fix it I waxed the outer fabric using a paraffin and beeswax coating. 
Ideally water and dirt would repel off of the coating instead of staining the fabric.

This was my first time of waxing anything so this was a bit of a learning experience. 
The easiest way would probably have been to wax the fabric before assembling the bag.
You can simply apply the wax, and then use your steam iron to melt it into the fabric.

The downside is that you might have to clean your sewing machine since you'll probably spread wax while making the bag.
I decided to wax as my last step.

![The wax being slowly heated on a double boiler](images/18.png)
First I melted a combination of 9 parts paraffin and 1 part beeswax over a double boiler. 
Be careful while melting wax. 
If your wax catches fire you have the equivalent of an oil fire.
Do not try to put it out with water. 
Using a double boiler effectively eliminates that threat anyways as the wax isn't in contact with the hot plate. 
Maybe a bit overly cautious but better save than sorry.
Once you have melted and mixed your wax you can either let it harden as a bar for later use or apply it while it's liquid.
![A cooled bar of the wax mixture](images/19.png)

My approach for application was admittedly a bit... Comical.
I've read a lot online of using either a steaming iron, hair dryer or heat-gun to melt the wax into the fabric.
I decided that I didn't like the sound of any of those - they sounded like work - and used a brush to apply the melted wax directly to the fabric.
This will make it look like you have just spilled a whole candle over your newly made bag. 
But don't worry... Yet...
Next up i heated up my oven to around 70°C... Now you can worry.
In theory you can still use a heat-gun or something similar if you like that more.
But honestly poping it in the oven for 10 minutes also works really well.
Just make sure that all materials you have used can handle that. 
I removed the belt and belt clip and checked the [spec sheet](https://www.zotefoams.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/LD45-December-2017.pdf) of the padding that I used.
Plastezote LD45 is save to operate up to 100°C and the wax should melt above 60°C so we should be save in between those temperatures.
Make sure to use some fresh baking paper and keep an eye on the bag.
Make sure the bag doesn't touch any heating elements. 
Again wax fires are no joke.

From my singular attempt I can happily say this method works like a charm. 
After around 5-15 minutes with a flip in between all the wax melted into the fabric and the yellow color returned. 

## Finishing Touches
After all this work we are now basically done.
Adjust the length of the belt strap to your liking. May wears her bag around the hip and that certainly works.
You could also keep the strap very long and use it like a messenger bag. 
Here you can see my Eevee with her [hat](https://www.tumblr.com/tausmagicalwindmill/727707044733485056/operation-umbreon-hat) enjoying the bag.

It was a lot of work but I'm really happy with how it turned out.
